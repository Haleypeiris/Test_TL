Hello!

Question 1-4 are the files that are in this folder.

For question 5, the file I changed was data/spells/scripts/attack/eternal_winter.lua . Since the original spell was similar, I decided to modify the original spell rather than creating a new spell.

For question 6, I wasn't able to implmenent the shader code. I was looking into using framebuffers to create an afterimage by using different alpha values of the texture.

Question 7 files are within game_q7. To test it out yourself, drag the folder into \mods folder of the OT client. Then it should be a new tab on the top right where it can be open and see the window pop up.

Thanks for taking the time and looking at my work :D
